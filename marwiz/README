What is Python?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the "What is Python?" page (http://python.org/doc/Summary.html):

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. 
It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java.

Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has modules, 
classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing.  
There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various
windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk, Mac, MFC). New built-in modules are easily 
written in C or C++. Python is also usable as an extension language for 
applications that need a programmable interface.

The Python implementation is portable: it runs on many brands of UNIX, on 
Windows, DOS, OS/2, Mac, Amiga... If your favorite system isn't listed here, 
it may still be supported, if there's a C compiler for it. Ask around on 
comp.lang.python -- or just try compiling Python yourself.

The Python implementation is copyrighted but freely usable and distributable, 
even for commercial use.
